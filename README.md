# How to Interview Well

When your interviewer poses a question, be sure to:

Restate the problem

Translate the problem statement to plain English, and give a concrete example
that demonstrates the problem. If you’re asked to write code for a given task,
coming up with an example input and the corresponding output is a good way
to do this.

If possible, take this as an opportunity to interact with your interviewer. Questions
are often ambiguous, and asking for clarification shows that you’re able to
think them through.

Sketch your solution

Before writing any “real” code, explain the high-level steps you need to take to
solve the problem. Think of this as pseudocoding, and explain each step to your
Interviewer.

Discuss your approach

Take a moment to explain why you approached the problem as you did. If your
solution isn’t as efficient as possible, this is a good time to point that out. Don’t
get hung up in producing the best solution at this stage—focus on producing a
solution that you can improve later.

Implement your solution

This is where you write your code. Don’t use psuedocode. Instead, write syntactically
correct Python.

Be sure to use expressive, well-considered names for your variables and functions.
Just because you’re coding doesn’t mean you can stop communicating. Explain
what you’re doing each step of the way.

If and when you run into issues, approach solving it the same way you approached
the original problem—explain it, sketch a solution, etc.


Discuss shortcomings and improvements

When you’re done, take a moment to reflect on your solution and ways to
improve it.

Can you think of any ways to make it more efficient, more readable, or more
robust? State them here.

If you’re familiar with time complexity, now is a good time to mention it.


# Possible questions and responses:

## Python
- what libraries do you use?
- how do you read from a db?
- suppose some files are missing from a directory. we have a list of all the files we should have. How would you find the missing ones?

## SQL
- what is the difference between an inner join and a left join?
- how would you join these two tables?
- what does this window function do?
- Otherwise, anything from sqlzoo.net

## ML/AI
- tell me about some models you've made
- do you have a preferred algorithm?
- let's say you don't have a lot of observations. would you upsample or downsample?
- how would you prep your text data?
- talk to me about NLP

## Finance
- how do you do a vlookup?
- how would you value a company?
- explain OLS
- interpret this income statement

## AMZ/Google questions
These are super hard. An entire packet is given to you of things to prep for: https://www.mtu.edu/career/students/networking/interviews/prepare.pdf
Otherwise...
Federal jobs always come with leadership questions. Even for non-leadership positions. Be prepared for these!

- Personality questions? biggest weakness?

Generic questions deserve generic answers. Google the most common personality questions, memorize them, eliminate that bother, and focus on the real problems.

If, like me, you are bad at interviewing:

Fall back on technical knowledge, talk about your previous projects. Though past performance is no guarantee of future performance, talk about your previous projects and accomplishments. 

reduce the stress by making it conversational.
